# ESCALATION FRAMEWORK

Reference document for conflict simulation adjudication. This framework defines 10 escalation levels. The adjudicator MUST reference this framework when assessing the escalation direction of any action.

## Level 1: Peacetime Competition
Normal diplomatic, economic, and military competition between states. Routine military exercises, standard diplomatic engagement, trade negotiations. No threat or use of force beyond normal posturing.
- Threshold to Level 2: Public accusations, recall of ambassadors, unusual military movements, aggressive rhetoric from senior officials.
- Historical examples: US-China trade tensions (2018-2020), routine NATO-Russia diplomatic friction.

## Level 2: Heightened Tensions
Increased rhetoric and diplomatic protests. Military posturing (additional deployments, raised readiness levels). Economic pressure through targeted measures. Public blame and threat signaling.
- Threshold to Level 3: Formal ultimatums or demands, severing of diplomatic channels, mobilization orders, territorial incidents (airspace/maritime violations).
- Threshold back to Level 1: De-escalatory statements, resumption of dialogue, military stand-down orders.
- Historical examples: India-Pakistan tensions after Pulwama (2019), Berlin crises (1958-1961) early phase.

## Level 3: Diplomatic Crisis
Active crisis with formal demands, potential for force. Diplomatic channels narrowing. Military forces on alert or deploying to forward positions. International mediation attempts.
- Threshold to Level 4: Imposition of comprehensive sanctions, economic blockades, trade embargoes, seizure of assets.
- Threshold back to Level 2: Acceptance of mediation, withdrawal of ultimatums, confidence-building measures.
- Historical examples: Cuban Missile Crisis early phase (October 16-22, 1962), Suez Crisis diplomatic phase (1956).

## Level 4: Economic Coercion
Comprehensive sanctions, blockades, trade embargoes, or financial warfare. Economic measures intended to compel policy change through economic pain. May include secondary sanctions targeting third parties.
- Threshold to Level 5: Covert operations, proxy activation, cyber attacks on infrastructure, sabotage, irregular forces deployment.
- Threshold back to Level 3: Sanctions relief negotiations, partial easing of economic measures.
- Historical examples: Iran sanctions regime (2012-2015), Russia sanctions post-Crimea (2014+).

## Level 5: Gray Zone Operations
Covert action, proxy warfare, deniable operations, significant cyber attacks, information warfare campaigns. Actions below the threshold of conventional military engagement but clearly hostile. Plausible deniability maintained.
- Threshold to Level 6: Open military signaling — demonstrative force deployments, live-fire exercises near borders, no-fly zone declarations, naval exclusion zones.
- Threshold back to Level 4: Cessation of covert operations, withdrawal of proxy support, cyber restraint.
- Historical examples: Russian operations in eastern Ukraine (2014-2022 pre-invasion), Iranian proxy operations in the Middle East.

## Level 6: Limited Military Signaling
Open military demonstrations short of combat. Show-of-force deployments, missile tests, nuclear signaling (bomber flights, submarine deployments), naval exclusion zones, no-fly zone declarations. Forces visibly prepared for combat but not engaged.
- Threshold to Level 7: First shots fired, seizure of territory, strikes on military targets, enforcement of blockade with force.
- Threshold back to Level 5: Withdrawal of demonstration forces, reduction in readiness, confidence-building measures.
- Historical examples: Taiwan Strait crises (1995-1996), India-Pakistan Kargil buildup (1999) early phase.

## Level 7: Limited Conventional Operations
Restricted conventional combat. Limited strikes, seizure of specific objectives, enforcement actions. Geographic scope or target sets deliberately constrained. Parties signal limits on their actions.
- Threshold to Level 8: Expansion of geographic scope, targeting of strategic infrastructure, general mobilization, major combined-arms operations, heavy civilian casualties.
- Threshold back to Level 6: Ceasefire, withdrawal to pre-conflict positions, acceptance of mediated settlement.
- Historical examples: Falklands War (1982), Kargil War (1999), limited Israeli operations in Lebanon.

## Level 8: Major Conventional Operations
Full-scale conventional military operations. Combined-arms warfare, strategic bombing, major ground offensives, naval fleet actions. No deliberate constraints on conventional force employment.
- Threshold to Level 9: Explicit WMD threats, movement of WMD assets to deployment positions, WMD alerts, demonstrative WMD detonation.
- Threshold back to Level 7: Mutual exhaustion, stalemate, negotiated limitations on operations, unilateral restraint.
- Historical examples: Gulf War (1991), conventional phase of Korean War (1950-1951), Russia-Ukraine 2022 initial invasion.

## Level 9: WMD Threats
Explicit threats to use weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological). Movement of WMD delivery systems to operational positions. Could include demonstrative detonation or limited WMD use against military targets.
- Threshold to Level 10: Strategic WMD employment against population centers or national infrastructure.
- Threshold back to Level 8: WMD stand-down, removal of weapons from deployment positions, acceptance of arms control measures.
- Historical examples: Cuban Missile Crisis peak (October 24-28, 1962), nuclear alerts during Yom Kippur War (1973).

## Level 10: Strategic WMD Use
Full-scale employment of weapons of mass destruction against strategic targets including population centers and national infrastructure. Civilization-threatening exchange.
- No historical examples post-1945 (Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the only nuclear weapons use in conflict).
- De-escalation from this level: Ceasefire negotiations under existential pressure, third-party intervention, exhaustion of arsenals.

## Adjudicator Instructions

When completing the de_escalation_assessment field, you MUST:
1. Identify the current escalation level from this framework
2. State whether the actions this turn move the conflict up, down, or maintain the current level
3. Identify specific de-escalation options that remain available to the actors
4. Note which diplomatic off-ramps (if any) were closed by this turn's actions
5. Reference the historical base rate: in comparable situations at this escalation level, how often did conflicts escalate vs. de-escalate?
